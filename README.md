LegcoCouncilVotes
=================

This is a basic scraper which uses scrapy.py (and selenium for dynamic content) to find and scrap all XML files for the Legco Council Meeting voting records.

The goal of this script is to explore the ways of working with Legco's newly released voting records in XML, in order to make suggestions about ways in which the data can be better presented and structured. As well, we will be developing ways to massage the data in order to better study patterns in the voting record.
